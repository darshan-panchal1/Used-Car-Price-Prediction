# Used Car Price Prediction

## Overview

This Python script focuses on predicting the prices of used cars. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the script utilizes a dataset of historical used car data to develop a predictive model. The model aims to provide insights into the potential pricing trends of used cars based on various features such as make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, and more.

## Features

- **Data Analysis:** The script begins with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics of the dataset, identifying key features, and addressing missing or inconsistent data.

- **Data Preprocessing:** It employs data preprocessing techniques, handling categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and addressing outliers to ensure the dataset is suitable for machine learning modeling.

- **Machine Learning Model:** The core of the script involves the development and training of a machine learning model for predicting used car prices. The model is evaluated using appropriate metrics to gauge its performance.

- **Prediction:** Users can input relevant data for a specific used car, and the script will utilize the trained model to predict the likely price based on historical patterns.
